# Project Title

## Overview

This project is an extension of the base project [FoodReady](https://github.com/jyjoshi/cms). 
This component of the Canteen Management System utilizes cloud functions to implement serverless triggers for real-time notifications to canteens and customers. 
It also facilitates seamless backend updates, ensuring that all stakeholders have the latest information without the need for constant polling or manual updates.
